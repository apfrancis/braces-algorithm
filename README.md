An algorithm based problem solving exercise to balance braces. 
 
I did a similar problem on an online code challenge site and made a bit of a hash of it. So I had another go!

There are currently two algorithms that I've tried, both are their own node projects.

To run the code, simply run the tests. `cd` into `method1` or `method2`, run `npm install` and then `npm test`
